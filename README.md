# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study 
This optional capstone project is from the final course of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera. 

## INTRODUCTION
For this case study, I have been asked to perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at a fictional company, Cyclistic. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**.

## STEP 1: ASK
### How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
### 1a. Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations across Chicago. Cyclistic sets itself apart from other bike-share programs by providing a variety of bikes to their riders which makes bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bike.

Cyclistic's current marketing strategy relies on building general awareness and appealing to broader consumer segments. For instance, Cyclistic offers various pricing plans: single-ride passses, full-day passes, and annual memberships, which helps attract more customers. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are **casual riders**. Customers who purchase annual memberships are **Cyclistic members**.

Cyclistic's finance analysts have determined that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be essential to future growth. To do this, Moreno believes that creating a marketing campaign that targets current Cyclistic casual riders will provide us with a better chance of converting them into members. 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### 1b. Business Objectives
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me with the first question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?** 

### 1c. Business Task
To examine the differences between casual and annual members who use Cyclistic bikes with the goal of determining how to convert casual riders into annual members, thus, maximizing the number of annual memberships and furthering the company's future success.

### 1d. Key Stakeholder
**Cyclistic executive team**: The detailed-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve my recommended marketing program. My recommendations must be backed up with *compelling insights* and *professional data visualizations*.
